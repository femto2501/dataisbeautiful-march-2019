	   This is my submission for March 2019 - r/dataisbeautiful. Data - <a href="http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3/"> National Solar Radiation Data Base</a>

      The above bar graph shows the count of Station in each State, and their Class. Rhode Island, Virgin Islands, Guam and Delaware have the fewest stations. 
    </p>
	<img src="2.png" alt="Beeswarm - State vs Year" style="width:100%;height:width*538/1345">
	<p>
      The data consists of multiple datasets from each station from 1975 to 2005. The data is incomplete and each dataset consists of  12 months of data distributed over various years. The above beeswarm shows the dataset available for each State and Year/Month. There is a missing gap between 1983-1985, and 1992-1994. Majority of Class III datasets are located above 1995.
    </p>
	<img src="3.png" alt="Class - Density Stack vs Year" style="padding:0.5%;width:49.5%;height:width*400/700">
	<img src="4.png" alt="Class - Density Fill vs Year" style="padding:0.5%;width:49.5%;height:width*400/700">
	<p>
      The above two density graphs shows the density of Dataset as year progress, and their Class. Between 1975 to 1990 most of the dataset comes from Class I stations, While dataset above 1995 consists mostly of Class II and Class III. The two gaps in dataset can also be seen in this graph.

      Below animations show Dry Bulb Temperature and Dew Point Temperature. The dry-bulb temperature is the temperature of air measured by a thermometer freely exposed to the air but shielded from radiation and moisture. The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor.

      Above animations shows Dry Bulb Temperature (*C) for each month animated over 1995 to 2005, and the mean(bar) and median(dash) dry bulb temperature over the years 1995 to 2005. Black states denote data unavailable. December, January, and February being the coldest month while May, June, July being the hottest. Effects of Global warming can be seen in as less and less states average negative temperature in later years.

      Relative Humidity is expressed as a percentage; a higher percentage means that the airâ€“water mixture is more humid. At 100% relative humidity, the air is saturated and is at its dew point.
